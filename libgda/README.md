# libgda

`libgda` is an interface to the GDA architecture, providing a nice wrapper around the GDA interfaces, for both the client and the server parts.  
`libgda-sqlite` is a provider for `libgda` using SQLite as a backend.

`libgda` and `libgda-sqlite` are required for some gnome extensions such as [copyous](https://github.com/boerdereinar/copyous) to function.

## Compatibility
